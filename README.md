# CV
You probably want to open the [CV itself](https://github.com/VisualPaul/CV/blob/master/cv.pdf)
#### Why did you use moderncv?
Well, basically it looks OK, and I do not believe human resource managers are interested in my design skills (at the end of the
day, I am a software engineer). I would even imagine that they might appreciate similarly styled CVs since that allows them 
to pay less attention to design and more to the substance.
